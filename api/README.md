## APIs

Various APIs and API services for NMS.

NMS is largely composed for many APIs to many microservices.  

APIs can be accessed via REST and gRPC. 

See example/ directory for creating APIs that will work the same way for both REST and gRPC.

## Windows
Because windows do not support `**` wildcard, I recommand use git-bash to build /api on windows
